Game Templates for Windows 8
============================

These templates, enhanced to support Windows Store & Windows 8 features, are based on the default templates included with Construct 2 and are posted here with permission from Scirra.  The original templates can be found in Construct 2 via the New Project dialog or in the Construct/templates/ directory.  

To support publishing to the Windows Store, each template minimally features the following: 

+ [Windows 8 object](https://www.scirra.com/manual/145/windows-8).  Test mode and about/settings/privacy are set to off.
+ Pause layer
+ Windows 8 snapped view support that shows the Pause layer and pauses the game
+ [Touch object](https://www.scirra.com/manual/119/touch) and touch input support (Note: some already had this)
+ Adjusted project properties

For a guide to publishing Construct-based games to the Windows Store, see ["How to make a Windows 8 app"](https://www.scirra.com/tutorials/272/how-to-make-a-windows-8-app).
